2-Axis Robotic System with OLED Eyes (Arduino Uno)
Overview
This project builds a dual-axis robotic system controlled by an Arduino Uno, featuring servo-driven movement and expressive OLED eyes. The OLED display animates blinking and eye movements, while the servo motors enable lifelike head motion. The setup is ready for Bluetooth control, allowing further interaction.

Features
ðŸŽ­ Expressive OLED Eyes with blinking animation

ðŸ•¹ Dual-Axis Head Movement (servo-based motion)

ðŸ“¡ Wireless Control (optional Bluetooth commands)

ðŸ”„ Idle Behavior for natural motion and reactions

Hardware Components
